Welcome to the open source software repositories developed by the Center for Disease Neurogenomics (CDN) at the <a href="https://icahn.mssm.edu">Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai</a> located in New York City.  We develop statistical methods and software to ask biological questions from the large-scale functional genomics datasets generated by the group and the broader genomics field.
 </p>

The members of the CDN are commited to developing software that is: 

- Open source 
- Well documented
- Scalable to large functional genomics datasets
- Statistically rigorous
- Reproducable 

We emphasize integration with standard practices from <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a> and <a href="https://bioconductor.org">Bioconductor</a>.
