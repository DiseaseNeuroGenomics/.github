Welcome to the open source software repositories developed by the members of the Center for Disease Neurogenomics (CDN) at the <a href="https://icahn.mssm.edu">Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai</a> located in New York City.  We develop statistical methods and software to ask biological questions from the large-scale functional genomics datasets generated by the group. 

The members of the CDN are commited to developing software that is: 

- Open source 
- Well documented
- Scalable to large functional genomics datasets
- Statistically rigorous
- Reproducable
